The University of Missouri has been my home for the last four months of my life and it has been nothing short of spectacular!
I've had the opportunity to be in a few clubs, one of them being the [MU VR Club](https://missouri.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/university-of-missouri-virtual-reality)

## ***I've been places too!***
I've travelled to a lot of places over the years since my family moves a lot. Although I've visited quite a few countries in my life time, there are a few that stand out, namely ***Nigeria, The Netherlands, and Germany***. [Here](https://github.com/andriyabbott/Final-Project-IT1000/blob/master/Places-before-Mizzou.md) are some of the cooler places that I've actually lived in.

## ***Not to brag, but I know a few languages***
Since I've been places in my lifetime, and actually living in some of those places made me learn the language of the people around me. In addition to languages spoken around the world, I've learnt a lot about programming languages too! So far, i've learnt a bit of Python, HTML and Javasript. Also, I know a bit of Markdown too. You can take a look at why it's so cool over [here](https://github.com/andriyabbott/Final-Project-IT1000/blob/master/MarkDown.md)
