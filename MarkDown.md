# Markdown is one of the coolest things ever
## Here's some of the things that I love about MarkDown
-  It's *really easy* and **fast to use**
    1. It's dead simple to learn 
    2. It has a lot of keyboard shortcuts
-  Also, it's used everywhere in the world today

|  Sites that use MarkDown: 	|                    	|

|                           	| GitHub             	|
|                           	| Slack              	|
|                           	| Facebook Messenger 	|
|                           	| Wikipedia          	|
- Also, you can include photographs to help convey your visuals even more:

- It's also great for developers who want to display code
`python`
```x = 1
if x == 1:
    # indented four spaces
    print("x is 1.")
```
